好的，遵照您的指示。我将依照 [[海明威英文写作的“四大原则”]]，对您关于“高价值学习产物”的笔记进行优化，使其更简洁、直接、有力。

---

### **Your Work Is Your Worth**

Your notes are not your assets.
Your list of skills is not your value.
Your true worth is the problems you have solved.
The proof is in the work you have shipped.

---

### **The Collector's Trap**

You read books. You save articles. You take notes.
This is collecting. It is not building.
Your notes are raw logs. They are unindexed data. They are useless to others.
A resume lists skills. It is a promise. It is not proof.

---

### **The Builder's Portfolio**

A builder has a portfolio.
It is a library of solutions. Each solution is a tool.
The tool solves a real problem. It is documented. It is tested. It works.

This is your moat.
An AI can write notes. It cannot fix a broken system. It cannot run a hard experiment.
Your report on that experiment is proof. It holds knowledge you earned.
This knowledge is yours. It cannot be copied.

Your solutions build on each other.
You solve one problem. The next becomes easier.
Your skill compounds. Your value grows.

---

### **The Plan**

Stop collecting. Start building.
Make a repository for your work.
For every problem you solve, create a record.

1.  **Define the problem.**
2.  **Show your analysis.**
3.  **Document your design.**
4.  **Present the results.**

This repository is your true resume.
When others show their reading list, you show your work.
That is the difference.
That is your worth.
