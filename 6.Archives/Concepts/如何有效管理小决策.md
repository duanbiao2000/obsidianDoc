### **MEMORANDUM**

**To:** All Teams
**From:** Leadership
**Date:** 2025-11-11
**Subject:** Decision Engineering Playbook: A Risk-Based Framework

**1. Objective**

To improve efficiency and focus our resources, we are adopting a standardized framework for decision-making. The goal is to systematize recurring, low-impact choices to free up cognitive capacity for the strategic work that drives value. This approach treats decision-making as an engineering discipline.

**2. The Core Principle: Risk-Driven Differentiation**

The foundation of this playbook is to differentiate decisions based on their risk profile. We will categorize all decisions using two dimensions:

*   **Reversibility:** How easily and cheaply can the decision be undone?
*   **Scope of Impact:** How widely does the decision affect our systems, teams, or users?

By assessing decisions against these criteria, we can apply the appropriate level of rigor and avoid over-analyzing low-risk issues.

**3. The Decision Matrix & Strategies**

Use the following matrix to guide your approach:

#### **1. Low Impact / High Reversibility (Routine Decisions)**
These are frequent, low-stakes choices where the cost of a mistake is negligible.
*   **Strategy:** **Automate, standardize, or delegate.** The primary goal is to eliminate the need for active decision-making.
*   **Example:** Using an automated code formatter (e.g., Prettier) to handle code style, eliminating debates on spacing or syntax.

#### **2. High Impact / High Reversibility (Team Alignment Decisions)**
These decisions affect the team's workflow but can be easily adjusted if they prove ineffective.
*   **Strategy:** **Seek quick consensus, enforce with tooling, and iterate.** Prioritize action over prolonged debate.
*   **Example:** Agreeing on a new linting rule, implementing it in the CI pipeline, and remaining open to refining it later.

#### **3. Low Impact / Low Reversibility (Contained Technical Decisions)**
These are focused changes that are difficult to reverse but have a limited blast radius.
*   **Strategy:** **Require focused analysis, rigorous testing, and a controlled rollout.** Document the rationale clearly.
*   **Example:** Refactoring a core, non-public utility function. This requires careful work but does not impact external APIs.

#### **4. High Impact / Low Reversibility (Strategic Decisions)**
These are major commitments with significant, lasting consequences. They are not "small decisions."
*   **Strategy:** **Mandate a formal review process.** This includes detailed documentation (e.g., RFC), multi-stakeholder alignment, and a comprehensive deployment plan with rollback procedures.
*   **Example:** Selecting a new primary database technology for a critical application.

**4. Next Steps**

All teams should begin applying this risk-based framework to their daily work. This approach will help us move faster, reduce cognitive overhead, and ensure our deep-thinking efforts are reserved for the decisions that matter most.
