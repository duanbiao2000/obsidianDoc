**Subject:** A New Framework for High-Impact Communication: The P-I-E Protocol

To improve clarity and efficiency in our discussions, we are adopting a standardized communication framework. This model, the **P-I-E Protocol**, is designed to structure our thinking and ensure messages are delivered with maximum impact. It replaces complex methods with a simple, powerful system.

### **1. The Core Principle: The P-I-E Protocol**

For any topic, structure your communication around these three steps:

*   **P (Problem):** What problem does this idea, tool, or process solve?
*   **I (Idea):** What is the core solution or key insight?
*   **E (Effect):** What is the direct result or benefit?

This protocol forces us to move beyond surface-level descriptions to communicate value and purpose.

### **2. The Verbal Toolkit: 5 Key Execution Phrases**

To implement the P-I-E protocol, internalize these five phrases. They are your standard toolkit for structuring clear, logical arguments.

1.  **`The core problem it tackles is...`**
    *   **Function:** Immediately frames the business context and need.

2.  **`What's clever/innovative about it is...`**
    *   **Function:** Highlights the unique value or core insight of your solution.

3.  **`The main difference is...`**
    *   **Function:** Defines the idea clearly by contrasting it with an alternative.

4.  **`As a result, you get...`**
    *   **Function:** Connects the idea directly to a measurable outcome or benefit.

5.  **`To put it simply, it's basically...`**
    *   **Function:** Summarizes a complex point to ensure universal understanding.

### **3. Application Example: Pitching a New Tool**

**Scenario:** Proposing the adoption of the software Obsidian.

*   **(P-I-E Mental Prep)**
    *   **P:** Information is siloed in separate documents.
    *   **I:** It uses local files and bidirectional links to create a knowledge network.
    *   **E:** It enables networked thinking and reveals unexpected connections between ideas.

*   **(Execution)**
    > "I propose we evaluate Obsidian. **The core problem it tackles is** that our current tools create isolated silos of information. **What's innovative about it is** its use of bidirectional links to build a true network of ideas. **As a result, you get** a system that helps you discover surprising new insights. **To put it simply, it's basically** a private Google for our team's collective brain."

### **4. Next Steps**

We encourage all teams to begin applying the P-I-E protocol in meetings, emails, and presentations. This framework is not about memorizing phrases; it is about adopting a more structured and effective way to communicate.
