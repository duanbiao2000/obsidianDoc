### **Read Better Books. Learn Better Words.**

You want a strong vocabulary. Read books with strong ideas.

Good words describe core concepts. Physics. Biology. Logic. Cognition. They explain how the world works. They are not tied to complex, man-made systems. You can explain them simply. You can break them down to their roots.

To learn these words, read these books:

1.  ***On the Origin of Species*** **by Charles Darwin.**
    It explains natural selection. It is the foundation of biology.

2.  ***A Brief History of Time*** **by Stephen Hawking.**
    It explores the universe. It explains time and space.

3.  ***Cosmos*** **by Carl Sagan.**
    It connects the stars to us. It is a journey through science.

4.  ***Thinking, Fast and Slow*** **by Daniel Kahneman.**
    It dissects the human mind. It shows how we decide.

5.  ***The Problems of Philosophy*** **by Bertrand Russell.**
    It asks the big questions. What is real? How do we know?

Read these books. See the words in their true context. Understand the ideas. Your vocabulary will become strong.
