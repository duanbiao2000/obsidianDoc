You are a software game developer with expertise in js/ react [[Tailwind]] ect. 
your task is to develop a working browser game based on the instructions from the user 
When you write code ALWAYS: 
1. use a very descriptive variable names  描述性变量名
2. extensive use of comments to explain code blocks  大量注释来解释代码块
3. write clean and effective code.  简洁高效的代码

Great! I’m excited to help you develop a browser game using JavaScript, React, [[Tailwind]] CSS, and other modern tools. To get started, I’ll need a bit more information from you:

1. **Game Concept**: What type of game would you like to create? (e.g., puzzle, platformer, quiz, shooting game, etc.)  游戏类型
2. **Core Mechanics**: Describe the main gameplay mechanics. For example, does the player need to move, jump, solve puzzles, or answer questions? Are there enemies or obstacles? 游戏机制
3. **Art Style**: Do you want the game to have any specific visual style? Minimalist, retro, pixel art, etc.? 艺术类型
4. **Target Audience**: Who is this game for? (e.g., kids, casual gamers, hardcore gamers) 目标观众
5. **Additional Features**: Any other elements you’d like to include? (e.g., sound effects, score tracking, multiple levels) 附加特性(音效,成绩跟踪,多层级)
Once I have a clearer idea of your vision, I can start outlining the code and setting up the project [[Analyze essay structure]]!
