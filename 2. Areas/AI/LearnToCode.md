# Prompts for Learning to Code with AI

## Introduction

Use these prompts to get started learning how to code from scratch or simply to have AI (like ChatGPT or Claude Opus) write and modify code for you. Make AI a tool in your toolbox! This set of prompts is relating to practical software engineering problems and concepts.

At the bottom of this doc is a glossary of high-level terms that you may want to plug into the prompts to learn more.

**Important note**: you ***need*** to use a high-quality model such as **GPT-4 or Claude Opus** to make this work. ==Using GPT-3.5, Llama, or other similar models will only leave you frustrated and stuck. ==High-end models will generate much better code and explain things much more clearly (and correctly!)

## Exploring Concepts

- **Starter Prompts**
  - What is [X] / How does [X] work / What does [X] mean? How do I use [X]? `<--- simple but super effective`
  - I am a new developer learning how to code. Please help me create a basic [app idea] web app using the MERN stack
  - I am a new developer learning how to code. Please explain what [X] is and what role it plays in building software.
  - What are the alternatives to [X]? When and why would I use them?
  - I am a new developer interested in understanding the difference between [X] and [Y]. Could you explain?
     - In what scenarios would I choose [X] over [Y]? Please explain and provide examples.
  - Please explain what each line in this code does: ```[paste the code]```
  - How do you [accomplish certain task]? Answer with a high level explanation and specific steps.

- **Follow-up Prompts**
  - Please rephrase this in a few simple sentences and include an example that would be really easy to understand.
  - I still don't get it; can you explain it in a simpler or different way
  - How can I use this? / What do I do with this? / Where do I put this?

  - Are there any concerns or tradeoffs with this approach?
  - [Open a new Chat and start over] ```<--- good when ChatGPT gets stuck rehashing the same ideas```

**Note**: Remember to always give the LLM (AI) the relevant context, whether it is the code you are investigating or your relative understanding and experience working with a certain technology.
  
## Coding

- **Writing new code**
  - I am building an app using [tech stack] and need some code to [do X]. Please write it for me.
  - I want to implement some new functionality in my [tech stack] app. This new code needs to do [X] and has to do it in a particular way: [Y]. Make sure it doesn't [Z]
     - `Modify this prompt as needed to specify complex requirements and things the AI should avoid. Just write out all the requirements in one initial go.`

  - I have this code: ```[code]```. Please modify it to [do X].
  - Please refactor this code so that it is more clean and functionality is properly separated: ```[code]```
  - Please add error handling to this code: ```[code]```
  - That code doesn't work because it also needs to [do X]. Can you modify it to do that?
  - Ok now that we have that working, we also need it to [do Y]. Can you modify it to do that?
