> [!note] Major Components of Gen AI Tech Computer 
> Hardware: Specialized semiconductor chips used for model training and inference. Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) and Google’s tensor processing units (TPUs) are commonly used to accelerate model training and inference. 
> 
> Cloud Platforms: Cloud computing infrastructures like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) are used to develop and host generative AI applications. 
> 
> Closed-Source Foundation Models: Large pre-trained models that are often accessible via API. Examples include OpenAI’s GPT. Databases: Storage mechanisms for vector embeddings. Examples include Pinecone. 
> 
> Deployment: Platforms used to deploy generative AI models. Examples include Clarifai. 
> 
> End-to-End Vertical Apps: these are end-user-facing applications that commonly use proprietary models. Examples include Midjourney and Runway. 
> 
> Model Hubs: Platforms like Hugging Face are used to share and host models End-User Applications: End-user-facing applications that do not use proprietary models. 
> 
> Observability: Systems used to gain visibility into AI system operations. 
> 
> Orchestration: Frameworks, systems, and methodologies used to coordinate activities across various tools and systems. Examples include LangChain. 
> 
> Open-Source Foundation Models: Large pre-trained models that have been released under an open-source license. 
> 
> Training and Fine-tuning: Tooling to train and ne-tune LLMs to optimize model output.
