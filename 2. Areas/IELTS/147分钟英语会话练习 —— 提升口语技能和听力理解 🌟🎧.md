Good morning Sarah, I have a new flash card for us to work on today. Take a look at this scene. What do you see happening here? Hi Mr. Davis, it shows two people in a cafe enjoying a chat over coffee. The man seems really amused by what the woman is saying. Excellent observation. Let's dive into using **phrasal verbs** to describe their actions and interactions. First, how can we describe what the man is doing as he listens to the woman? He looks like he's really laughing at her story because it's funny. **Laugh at** is perfect here; it means to show amusement in response to something.

Now, the woman is sharing something interesting. What phrasal verb could we use for her sharing her story? She could be **opening up** to him, since she's sharing personal or amusing details in a relaxed way. **Open up** is a great choice for someone who is sharing more about themselves in a conversation.

Now, looking at how they are sitting and interacting, what phrasal verb could we use if they started talking about deeper, more personal topics? They might **get into** deeper topics as they feel more comfortable with each other. **Get into** means to start discussing in more detail.

Suppose they decide to leave the cafe after their long chat. What phrasal verb would describe them leaving together? They would **head out** of the cafe. **Head out** means to leave a place.

Lastly, imagine if they plan to meet again. What phrasal verb can we use to describe making plans to see each other soon? They could **meet up** again next week at the same cafe. **Meet up** is often used to describe planning to see someone again.

Great job today, Sarah, using these phrasal verbs in real context really helps cement them in your memory. How are you feeling about them now? I'm getting more comfortable with them. It's fun to apply them to different scenarios like this. Thanks for the guidance, Mr. Davis. You're very welcome, Sarah. I'm glad you find the lessons enjoyable and useful. Keep practicing, and soon you'll be using phrasal verbs fluently in your everyday conversations.

Let's examine this new flash card, Sarah. What do you see here? It shows a woman and a young boy looking at a book together. The boy seems curious, and the woman is pointing something out in the book. That's a good description. Now let's use phrasal verbs to describe their actions. How would you describe what the woman is doing with the book using a phrasal verb? She's **pointing out** something in the book to the boy. **Point out** is when you draw attention to something specific.

Now, what about the boy? What phrasal verb can we use to describe how he's interacting with the woman and the book? He seems to be **looking on** as she explains the book. **Look on** is a great choice; it means to watch something happen.

If we imagine they finish with this book and the boy wants to read another one, what phrasal verb would describe the action of choosing a new book? He might **pick out** another book from the shelf. Well done, **pick out** means to choose something from a group.

Now, suppose the boy gets a bit restless and wants to do something else. What phrasal verb can describe his action of moving from reading to playing? He might **move on** to playing with his toys, instead. Perfect, **move on** is often used to show a change in activity.

Lastly, imagine they tidy up after their reading session. What phrasal verb describes the action of cleaning up the area where they were sitting? They would **clear up** the space, putting the books back and organizing the cushions. **Clear up** is exactly right; it involves making a space orderly again.

Fantastic job, Sarah. You're getting really good at applying these phrasal verbs to different scenarios. How do you feel about today's session? I feel great. It's becoming easier to think of the right phrasal verbs for different situations. Thank you, Mr. Davis. You're welcome, Sarah. It's wonderful to see your progress. Keep practicing, and soon using phrasal verbs will be effortless for you.

Let's continue with our phrasal verbs lesson using this new flash card. What's happening in this scene, Sarah? It shows a young woman and an older man sitting on a bench in a park. The woman is writing in a notebook, and the man seems to be talking to her. Very good. Let's start with the man. What phrasal verb could we use to describe him sharing his experiences or stories with the young woman? He might be **passing on** his knowledge or stories to her. Excellent choice, **pass on** can indeed be used to describe the act of transmitting knowledge or information.

How about the woman? What phrasal verb would describe her action of writing down what the man is saying? She is **jotting down** the details in her notebook. **Jot down** is perfect; it means to write something quickly.

Let's think about the context. If they began discussing various topics during their conversation, what phrasal verb could describe this action? They might **go over** different subjects, especially if the man is sharing various experiences. Right, **go over** means to review or discuss something in detail.

Suppose the woman needs to leave soon. What phrasal verb can we use for her preparing to leave the park? She would **head off** from the park to her next destination. Exactly, **head off** means to leave somewhere.

Lastly, if after their meeting they decide to continue their discussions on another day, what phrasal verb would be suitable for making plans to meet again? They could **set up** another meeting. Perfect, **set up** can be used to arrange or schedule something.

Sarah, you've done wonderfully today in applying these phrasal verbs. How do you feel about them now? Thanks, Mr. Davis. It's becoming more intuitive to use them in conversation. These practical examples really help. I'm glad to hear that. It's important to connect the language we learn with real-life contexts. Keep practicing, and you'll master these in no time. Keep up the great work!

Let's proceed with this next flash card, Sarah. What do you see in this image? It shows a young man carrying groceries, walking alongside an elderly woman who is holding a shopping cart. They seem to be chatting and walking together happily. Well described. Let's use some phrasal verbs to talk about their actions. First, the young man with the groceries. What phrasal verb can we use to describe his action of carrying items for the elderly woman? He is **helping out** the elderly woman by carrying her groceries. Yes, **help out** is perfect for describing assisting someone.

And what about the action of the elderly woman, walking with the young man? What phrasal verb could we use here? She could be **going along** with him down the street. Correct, **go along** means to accompany someone somewhere.

Now, suppose they stop to talk to someone they know. What phrasal verb can describe the action of initiating a conversation with a passer-by? They might **strike up** a conversation with a neighbor they meet. Exactly, **strike up** means to start a conversation, often casually.

Imagine, after the young man leaves the groceries with the woman, he continues on his way. What phrasal verb would you use for his departure? He could **head off** after making sure she's settled. **Head off** is ideal for describing leaving a place.

Lastly, if the elderly woman later talks about how helpful the young man was, what phrasal verb can we use for sharing this positive feedback? She might **pass on** her compliments to others, telling them about his kindness. Wonderful use of **pass on**; it's often used to relay information or feelings to others.

Excellent work today, Sarah. You're becoming quite adept at this. How are you feeling about using phrasal verbs now? It's getting easier to think of the right ones in context. These exercises help a lot, Mr. Davis. Thank you. You're very welcome, Sarah. Your progress is impressive. Keep up the hard work, and you'll master these phrasal verbs in no time.

Let's analyze this new flash card, Sarah. Describe the scene for me. It shows two women at a cafe, one is listening intently while the other is explaining something, perhaps sharing advice or a story. Great observation. What phrasal verb can we use for the woman who is explaining something to her friend? She could be **laying out** her ideas or advice. Perfect, **lay out** means to explain something clearly or to present information systematically.

Now, how about the woman who is listening? What phrasal verb fits her attentive behavior? She's **taking in** the information, listening carefully to understand it. Exactly, **take in** is used to describe absorbing or comprehending information.

Suppose the listener disagrees or has a different point of view. What phrasal verb could describe her starting to express her own opinion? She might **speak up** to share her thoughts or disagree with a point. **Speak up** is right; it means to express one's opinion openly and confidently.

Imagine now that after their conversation, they decide to leave the cafe together. What phrasal verb would describe them leaving? They would **head out** of the cafe together. **Head out** indeed means to depart from a place.

Finally, if they plan to discuss this topic further another day, what phrasal verb would describe scheduling their next meeting? They might **set up** another coffee date to continue their discussion. **Set up** is an excellent choice for making arrangements.

Well done, Sarah. How are you feeling about integrating these phrasal verbs into everyday situations now? It's really helpful to practice like this, Mr. Davis. I feel more confident about using phrasal verbs naturally, thanks for the effective examples. You're very welcome, Sarah. Your progress is impressive.
