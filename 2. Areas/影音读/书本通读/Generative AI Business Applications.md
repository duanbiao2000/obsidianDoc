> [!note] Major Components of Gen AI Tech Computer 
> Hardware: Specialized semiconductor chips used for model training and inference. Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) and Google’s tensor processing units (TPUs) are commonly used to accelerate model training and inference. 
> 
> Cloud Platforms: Cloud computing infrastructures like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) are used to develop and host generative AI applications. 
> 
> Closed-Source Foundation Models: Large pre-trained models that are often accessible via API. Examples include OpenAI’s GPT. Databases: Storage mechanisms for vector embeddings. Examples include Pinecone. 
> 
> Deployment: Platforms used to deploy generative AI models. Examples include Clarifai. 
> 
> End-to-End Vertical Apps: these are end-user-facing applications that commonly use proprietary models. Examples include Midjourney and Runway. 
> 
> Model Hubs: Platforms like Hugging Face are used to share and host models End-User Applications: End-user-facing applications that do not use proprietary models. 
> 
> Observability: Systems used to gain visibility into AI system operations. 
> 
> Orchestration: Frameworks, systems, and methodologies used to coordinate activities across various tools and systems. Examples include LangChain. 
> 
> Open-Source Foundation Models: Large pre-trained models that have been released under an open-source license. 
> 
> Training and Fine-tuning: Tooling to train and ne-tune LLMs to optimize model output.

> To connect data to an LLM, several approaches can be taken. these include few-shot prompting, re-tuning, and retrieval augmented generation (RAG). these techniques help reduce hallucinations, improve accuracy and transparency, stay up-to-date, and apply business context and data

>  For example, Bloomberg—which has signicant resources at its disposal, including data engineers, ML engineers, and most importantly decades of high-quality nancial data to train the model—created a purpose-built nancial model from scratch called BloombergGPT.33 However, for most companies, building an LLM model and application isn’t a practical or reasonable option due to excessive cost.

> **Case Studies** 
> The Japanese company Hitachi is leveraging generave AI to transfer expert skills in maintenance and manufacturing to new employees, an iniave to address the challenge of experienced workers rering in mass due to demographics. AI technology generates virtual simulaons, including videos of railway, power staon, and manufacturing plant difficules or accidents for immersive employee training. The system, sll under development, uses 3D data to project malfuncons and other scenarios onto images of actual sites, enabling trainees to experience and learn from virtual representaons of real-world issues. The aim is to impart tacit knowledge, which is oen hard to convey through tradional manuals, to the next generaon of workers. Hitachi plans to use this system internally and may offer it to customers in the future.16 Naonal Grid collaborated with Hive Learning to create the Future Leaders program that aims to upskill emerging talent in the United Kingdom and United States. This leadership development program, designed according to Naonal Grid’s 5 Manager Essenals Framework, offers personalized learning for effecve leadership in challenging environments. Achieving a 100 percent registraon rate, it demonstrated significant demand and contributed to bridging the skills gap in the energy industry, ulmately enhancing leadership behaviors and career progression.17 BSH Home Appliances Group faced challenges in global knowledge disseminaon and the high costs of tradional video producon. BSH employed Synthesia’s AI technology to transform their training. By creang AI-driven, cost-efficient training videos, BSH achieved a 70 percent reducon in external video producon costs and a 30 percent increase in learning engagement. This not only improved training efficiency but also scaled knowledge sharing among 60,000 employees worldwide, leading to over 30,000 views of web-based training.
