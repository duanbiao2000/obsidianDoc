Based on the notes and documents retrieved in our conversation, please identify and summarize the key practical action plans and workflow recommendations. For each recommendation, include:  
1. The specific note/document it comes from  
2. A brief description of the recommended workflow or action plan  
3. How it could be implemented in practice  
4. Any tools or frameworks mentioned that support this workflow  
  
Please organize your response by categories (e.g., AI development workflows, knowledge management, project structuring) and prioritize the most immediately actionable recommendations.
```

```
Please analyze the file `2.Sphere\认知科学\system-design-primer.md` and provide:  
  
1. A structured breakdown of its core concepts and underlying logic, particularly focusing on the cognitive load theory perspective and the 4-step methodology mentioned.  
  
2. Identify specific connections between this file and other notes in the repository, especially those related to knowledge organization, cognitive science, or system design principles.  
  
3. Recommend which notes could potentially be merged with this one to reduce redundancy, based on thematic overlap. For each recommendation, explain the specific overlapping concepts and how they could be consolidated.  
  
Please reference specific files by their full paths when making connections or merger recommendations.

```
Please analyze the file `2.Sphere\认知科学\TensorFlow 核心架构.md` and provide:  
  
1. A comprehensive summary of its main content, key concepts, and architectural components described in the document  
2. Identify other notes in the repository that are strongly related to TensorFlow architecture, machine learning frameworks, or AI system design  
3. For each related note you identify, explain the specific connection to the TensorFlow architecture document and how they complement each other  
4. Prioritize the relationships based on relevance (high, medium, low)  
  
Please reference specific files by their full paths when identifying related notes.
