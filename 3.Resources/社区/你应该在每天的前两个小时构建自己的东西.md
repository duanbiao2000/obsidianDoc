Quitting your job for your dream is reckless.  
为了梦想而辞掉工作是鲁莽的。

This idea needs to die. It’s unrealistic to go from a regular salary to $0 and build some business, movement, or not-for-profit based on hope.  
这个想法需要消亡。从固定工资变为 0 美元并基于希望建立一些业务、运动或非营利组织是不现实的。

The way I built my own thing was using the first 2 hours of the day in a different way to most people. Change how you use the first 2 hours of the day, transform your life.  
我构建自己的东西的方式是以与大多数人不同的方式利用一天的前两个小时。改变你一天中前 2 个小时的使用方式，改变你的生活。

## Building out of desperation leads to disaster  
绝望中的建设会导致灾难

When I say build your own thing, I’m talking about building something online.  
当我说构建你自己的东西时，我指的是在线构建东西。

A social media audience, online business, movement, paid community, newsletter, blog, network, etc – the options are endless.  
社交媒体受众、在线业务、运动、付费社区、时事通讯、博客、网络等——选择是无穷无尽的。

To master this goal you first need to ensure you don’t make the #1 mistake: building out of desperation. A guy I met, James, illustrates this perfectly. He wanted to build an empire online around mindfulness.  
为了实现这个目标，你首先需要确保你不会犯第一个错误：出于绝望而建造。我遇到的一个人，詹姆斯，完美地说明了这一点。他想围绕正念建立一个在线帝国。

> “I have $1000 left to my name & need to have this make money in the next 30 days.”  
> “我的名下还剩下 1000 美元，需要在接下来的 30 天内赚钱。”

As a result he was looking for shortcuts, tricks, and to buy followers. He even considered spamming people with his mindfulness course. The week after I met him he was putting links to his programs all over other writers’ Substack post comments.  
因此，他寻找捷径、技巧并购买追随者。他甚至考虑向人们发送正念课程的垃圾邮件。在我见到他的一周后，他在其他作家的 Substack 帖子评论中添加了他的程序的链接。

This is what desperation does. It makes you weak. It makes you look cheap. And that’ll repel people the way bug spray murders spiders.  
这就是绝望的作用。它让你变得虚弱。它让你看起来很廉价。这会像杀虫剂杀死蜘蛛一样驱散人们。

What works better is to make sure you have your main income locked down first, then you build your online empire.  
更好的方法是确保首先锁定你的主要收入，然后再建立你的在线帝国。

## The day is won or lost in the morning  
一天的胜利或失败都在早晨

It’s common to leave building your own thing until the end of the day. This is when your energy is the lowest and you’re least disciplined.  
直到一天结束才构建自己的东西是很常见的。这是你精力最低、纪律最差的时候。

The temptation to trade the 2 hours you have to build your freedom machine for some Netflix or drinks with friends is too high, even for a David Goggins navy seal-type.  
即使对于大卫·戈金斯 (David Goggins) 那样的海豹突击队来说，用建造自由机器的 2 小时去看 Netflix 或与朋友喝酒的诱惑也太大了。

What’s worse is those who plan to build their own thing on weekends or holidays. And the ultimate failure is to build your own thing when you’re retired (may as well set the dream on fire right now).  
更糟糕的是那些计划在周末或假期建造自己的东西的人。最终的失败是在退休后建立自己的东西（不妨现在就点燃梦想）。

What you can control is today.  
你能控制的就是今天。

The first 2 hours of every day are an opportunity most will piss all over. I famously remember one guy my friend Ayo spoke to who said they had no time to build anything. They handed over their daily schedule. It included an hour for eating breakfast and 2 hours of housework in the morning.  
每天的前两个小时是大多数人尿尿的机会。我记得我的朋友阿约和一个人交谈过，他说他们没有时间建造任何东西。他们交出了每天的日程安排。其中包括一个小时的早餐时间和早上的两个小时的家务劳动。

```
If you bullsh*t yourself, no one can help you.
```

We can find 2 hours to build if we understand how important it is. The way I do that is to consider the alternative…  
如果我们了解它的重要性，我们可以花 2 个小时来构建。我这样做的方法是考虑替代方案……

## Defy what the system told you  
违背系统告诉你的

Parents, university, bosses, employers, friends and/or cultural norms in your country likely all told you to follow a predictable path.  
父母、大学、老板、雇主、朋友和/或您所在国家的文化规范可能都告诉您要遵循可预测的道路。

These predictable paths create the societal system that enslaves most people without them realizing it.  
这些可预测的路径创造了一种社会制度，在大多数人没有意识到的情况下奴役了他们。

My friend Niha is a woman from India. She quit her consulting career to work 3 hours a day as an online writer. Her family thinks she’s nuts. Her former colleagues barely speak to her. Not even her husband gets it.  
我的朋友尼哈是一位来自印度的女性。她辞去了咨询职业，成为一名每天工作 3 小时的在线作家。她的家人认为她疯了。她以前的同事几乎不和她说话。就连她的丈夫也无法理解。

She said to me: 她对我说：

> “Women aren’t this bold in my culture. They have a place. They go to university, get a job their parents approve of, then get married to someone who’s chosen for them and start popping out kids.”  
> “在我的文化中，女性没有这么大胆。他们有一席之地。他们上大学，找到父母认可的工作，然后与为他们挑选的人结婚，并开始生孩子。”

She wanted more out of life so she said no.  
她想要更多的生活，所以她拒绝了。

If you don’t build for the first 2 hours, what you have is the nightmare of the predictable path that a lot of people are trying to escape and don’t know how.  
如果你不在前 2 小时内进行构建，那么你将面临的就是许多人试图逃离但不知道如何逃离的可预测路径的噩梦。

You don’t escape prison in a moment’s notice. Watch the TV show Prison Break. You build an escape plan then slowly test it until you make your calculated escape.  
你不可能立即逃脱监狱。观看电视节目《越狱》。你制定一个逃生计划，然后慢慢地测试它，直到你按照计划逃走。

The way we deal with the downsides of a conventional life society wants to have is to eat sugar, drink alcohol, drown in distractions, and to endlessly entertain ourselves to death with Netflix and superhero movies.  
我们应对传统生活社会所希望的弊端的方式就是吃糖、喝酒、沉浸在分心的事物中，并无休止地用Netflix和超级英雄电影自娱自乐。

There’s a better way of life.  
有更好的生活方式。

## Go all in like a mofo  
像mofo一样全力以赴

Ideas are like a\*\*holes, everyone has them.  
想法就像一个\*\*洞，每个人都有。

The only way this first 2 hours of every day plan works is if you commit. Scrap that. It only works if you go all in like a mofo.  
每天计划的前 2 小时要想发挥作用，唯一的办法就是你全身心投入。废掉那个。只有当你像mofo一样全力以赴时，它才会起作用。

Lukewarm plans are easy to override. Full-on commitment is harder to back out of, especially if you tell others who will hold you accountable.  
不冷不热的计划很容易被推翻。全面的承诺是很难撤销的，尤其是当你告诉其他人谁会追究你的责任时。

I always built my own thing while working a job. It’s only when the 2020 layoffs were in full swing that I ramped up my efforts. I went from working on my thing when I could to blocking off whole mornings.  
我总是在工作的同时建造自己的东西。直到2020年裁员如火如荼的时候，我才加大力度。我从尽可能地做自己的事情变成了整个早晨的空闲时间。

I had no expectations. The mornings I did it were lonely. Complete solitude. It was just me and the sound of birds outside my apartment window.  
我没有任何期望。我这样做的早晨很孤独。完全的孤独。只有我和公寓窗外的鸟鸣声。

**It’s hard to describe it.** They were some of the best days of my life. Some of my clearest writing came out of me.  
**很难描述它。**那是我一生中最美好的时光。我的一些最清晰的写作是我自己写出来的。

People close to me knew I wasn’t f\*cking around. In a way, it made them quietly proud of me. They saw I was growing from a child living in an adult’s body into a man who lived up to his values and couldn’t be controlled by anyone or anything.  
我身边的人都知道我不是在胡闹。在某种程度上，这让他们默默地为我感到骄傲。他们看到我从一个生活在成人身体里的孩子成长为一个恪守自己价值观、不受任何人或任何事控制的男人。

The 2 hours a day were hard to get in.  
每天2小时的时间很难进去。

My work email was always overflowing. I got so ruthless toward the end of this journey that I started to show up for my day job later and later. It used to be 8 AM, then 9, then 10, then right at the end I was clocking in at 11 AM.

Checking out of a job so I could check into my real goal felt incredible.

## It starts with releasing your ideas  
从释放你的想法开始

Ideas stay trapped in our heads.

The pressure to release those ideas builds up like a toilet with a turd clogging it up. To get some relief, we start to get fantasies of writing a book.

We tell ourselves we’ll put our ideas in there. We may take some notes over time. We may even write some chapters of the book.

_But the book never comes out._

Finally, we retire at 65 and write the book. Then we publish it on Amazon and nobody reads it. Now we think our ideas weren’t that good and it ends in what I call last-leg-of-life depression. Feelings we could have been more, as well as deep regrets.

We continue to grow old, then join the long queue for the cemetery and wait our turn. All that potential then turns to dirt and the worms munch on your remains.

The simple solution isn’t to let ideas clog up our minds.

Part of building your own thing is to release your ideas into the online world through social media.

-   These ideas become the foundation for whatever you want to build.
    
-   They also help you attract the people who can help you build, and for whom you’re building something for.
    

This daily release of ideas stops fantasies of writing books from destroying your life.

## Listen to your curiosity. Pay attention to your true desires.  
听听你的好奇心。关注你的真实愿望。

Humans are great at settling.

We hide our true desires and convince ourselves an office job or by-the-hour manual labor work is our calling. It’s not. To build something of your own you have to dare to follow your curiosity.

My 1 year old daughter is growing up fast. I can’t wait to tell her that her dad is Alice from the book “Alice In Wonderland.” I spend entire days falling down rabbit holes and not coming up for air. I let my curiosity go absolutely wild.

It’s fun as hell.

Some days that leads me to become the mad hatter from the story, too. But inside madness and chaos is our ability to transcend ourselves. Our curiosity is the map to our true desires that we so eloquently bury and let die when we become adults.

Curiosity is the path back to happiness.

Let’s get practical.

### 1\. Wake up earlier

If you have a job or kids, then some parts of the day aren’t flexible. I had the same problem. The only solution is to wake up earlier.

It sounds crazy the first time you think of it. But if you can wake up earlier for a week you’ll realize it’s 100% possible. You either find the time or let excuses like “I have kids dontcha know” hold you back.

I don’t give a sh\*t if you think your life is special. It’s not. Make it happen or watch others make it happen. Own or be owned. Choice is yours.

### 2\. Try removing the warm-up routine

The song and dance with morning routines is ridiculous.

One way to build in the first 2 hours of the day is to remove the warm-up. No morning routine. No “I’ll start after my coffee.” No “I’ll read my emails first.” Nope. Just do the hardest step and start. Get straight into it and watch how fast you get momentum.

### 3\. Start the night before

Every night I used to write down what I wanted to do in my 2 hours of power the following morning. I still do this today.

Looking at a blank screen is a nightmare. We have things we want to build and there are steps to take to make it happen. Some pre-planning works wonders so you can just wake up and start.

Start your morning the night before.

### 4\. Leave this devil device out of sight

The devil doesn’t wear Prada. The devil is your phone.

This distraction machine will guarantee you don’t have 2 hours in the morning. Easy solution is to leave your phone out of sight. No Whatsapp/Telegram. No emails. No phone calls or checking the weather or seeing what meetings you have.

That last one is key. When I used to be foolish enough to sometimes look at what meetings I had for the day first thing, the anxiety would start to build. I’d get so anxious I couldn’t build anything in the first 2 hours of the day.

It was 10x worse for me because I used to suffer from anxiety. It used to make my hands shake all day, give me runny poos, and exclude me from social events. It ultimately ended in the collapse of my successful eCommerce business.

The best work is done in a calm, relaxed state. Remove the phone and anxiety from the early morning, and you’ll build better.

### 5\. Giggle like Pamela Anderson and have fun

The joker in Batman was right: “Why so serious?”

That’s why I hate modern adult life and working for corporations. It’s all too serious. The point of building your own thing for 2 hours every day is to come alive and have fun. It’s to experience the pure joy of creation. It’s to make up your own rules.

Make sure what you’re building is fun.

## Closing Thought 结束语

The good life starts with one small step.

Building your own thing for the first 2 hours of every day is the best logical step you can take right now. I freaking dare you to give it a go and see what happens.

Tell me what you want to build (or are building) and why in the comments.
