Stamina usually has a physical and competitive connotation — those with greater stamina can outwork and outlast opponents.  
耐力通常具有身体和竞争的含义——耐力更强的人可以比对手更努力、更持久。

While stamina is the ability to sustain focused effort despite pain or discomfort, you should also think of it as the ability to stay true to your values and commitments — to hold [fidelity to a worthy purpose](https://kupajo.com/do-the-right-things-quietly/) — especially when it’s hard to do so.  
虽然耐力指的是不顾疼痛或不适坚持集中精力的能力，但你也应该把它看作是坚守自己的价值观和承诺的能力—— [忠于一个有价值的目标](https://kupajo.com/do-the-right-things-quietly/) ——尤其是在很难做到的时候。

Stamina, in this way, is not just the thing you deploy to [keep running when your legs have gone volcanic](https://kupajo.com/its-good-to-quiver-under-the-bar/). It’s contributing as part of a team that, let’s say, has posed a challenging experience for all involved. It’s returning for another go at a problem that has repeatedly turned your mind into oatmeal (the kind with that creepy skin after it’s been left out awhile). It’s being a patient parent or partner despite bone-deep exhaustion.  
从这个意义上讲，耐力不仅仅是[当你的双腿已经筋疲力尽时用来继续奔跑的](https://kupajo.com/its-good-to-quiver-under-the-bar/)东西。耐力是作为团队的一员做出贡献，比如说，为所有参与者带来了挑战。耐力是再次解决一个让你的头脑变成燕麦片的问题（那种在被搁置一段时间后会长出令人毛骨悚然的燕麦片的问题）。耐力是尽管筋疲力尽，但仍能耐心地做父母或伴侣。

It’s the ability to chip away at goals despite a lack of visible progress. To hold focus and presence in a world incentivized to distract you. To stay patient. To be on time. To push through difficult material. To follow instructions or proceed without them. To keep an open mind and be willing to renew your perspective.  
**它是在缺乏明显进展的情况下，逐步实现目标的能力。** 在一个充满诱惑分散你注意力的世界中保持专注和存在感。保持耐心。准时。克服困难。遵循指示或不遵循指示继续前进。保持开放的心态并愿意更新你的观点。

Stamina is one of the most universally useful traits you can develop — it’s a more broadly applicable advantage than things that are situationally useful, like strength, intelligence, speed, popularity, motivation, etc.  
耐力是人们可以培养的最普遍有用的特质之一 — — 它比力量、智力、速度、受欢迎程度、动力等特定情况下有用的特质具有更广泛的适用性。

Maybe a smarter, more naturally gifted person can be sporadically brilliant, and solve a tough problem way faster than you. But you, with your staying power, can more capably and reliably solve the 100 problems that follow.  
也许一个更聪明、更有天赋的人偶尔会表现出色，比你更快地解决难题。但凭借你的持久力，你可以更有能力、更可靠地解决接下来的 100 个问题。
