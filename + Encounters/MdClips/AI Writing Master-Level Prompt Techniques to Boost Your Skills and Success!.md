Many of you might have had this experience:

**You want AI to help write something, but you’re unsure how to start the conversation.**
<!--SR:!2025-03-20,3,250-->

So, you just give a command like, “Write me an article!”

But the result? The content doesn’t match your expectations at all.

In fact, communicating with AI requires some skill.

Today, I want to share a practical method with you: let the AI ask you questions.

Why let the AI ask questions? AI, in essence, is like an experienced writing assistant.

It needs to understand your specific requirements to generate content that meets your expectations.

However, we often don’t even know exactly what we want. In such cases, why not let the AI guide you step by step to clarify your thoughts?

Here’s how to do it:

I’ve summarized a handy prompt template:

> You are now a seasoned writing coach. I need to write an article on <topic>. Please help me organize the necessary elements by asking me questions.

1\. Ask one question at a time.

2\. Continue asking follow-up questions based on my responses.

3\. Questions should be specific and pointed.

4\. Stop asking after collecting all the elements in three to five questions, then start writing the article.

Here’s an example of how it works. You can see how the AI gathers details about the target audience and the key points you want to convey through its questions.

```

Through structured questioning, AI helps you organize your thoughts, avoid missing crucial details, and make the writing process more logical.
