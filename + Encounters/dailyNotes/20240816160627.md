## First Principles: Thinking from Scratch

**First principles thinking** is essentially the art of breaking down a problem into its most fundamental components, and then rebuilding it from the ground up. It's about questioning every assumption and looking for the underlying truths.  

### Key aspects of first principles thinking:

- **Challenging assumptions:** Don't accept existing solutions or beliefs without question.
- **Identifying fundamental truths:** Discover the core elements that form the foundation of a problem.  
- **Building from scratch:** Create new solutions based on these fundamental truths, without being constrained by conventional wisdom.

**An example:**

- **Problem:** The cost of space travel is too high.
- **First principles thinking:** Break down the cost of space travel into its basic components (rocket fuel, materials, labor, etc.) and find radically new ways to reduce each component's cost.

**In essence, first principles thinking is about:**

- **Innovation:** By starting from scratch, you can uncover new and creative solutions.
- **Efficiency:** By focusing on fundamental truths, you can eliminate unnecessary steps and processes.
- **Problem-solving:** It's a powerful tool for tackling complex challenges.
