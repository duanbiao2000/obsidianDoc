## Happiness  
幸福

1\. You don’t have to love your job. Jobs are a way to make money. Many people live fine lives in okay jobs by using the money they make on things they care about.

[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_law#). Sturgeon’s law states that 90% of everything is crap. If you dislike poetry, or fine art, or anything, it’s possible you’ve only ever seen the crap. Go looking!  
[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_law#). 斯特金定律指出，90% 的東西都是垃圾。如果你不喜歡詩歌、美術或其他任何東西，你可能只看過那些廢話。去找吧！

[3](https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/YSWa8rYeD3aDaofSP/rational-home-buying). People don’t realize how much they hate commuting. A nice house farther from work is not worth the fraction of your life you are giving to boredom and fatigue.  
[3](https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/YSWa8rYeD3aDaofSP/rational-home-buying). 人們沒有意識到他們有多麼討厭通勤。離工作地點較遠的漂亮房子不值得你把生命中的一小部分花在無聊和疲勞上。

[4](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-43492-001). There’s some evidence that introverts and extroverts both benefit from being pushed to be more extroverted. Consider this the next time you aren’t sure if you feel like going out.

8\. Discipline is superior to motivation. The former can be trained, the latter is fleeting. You won’t be able to accomplish great things if you’re only relying on motivation.  
8\. 紀律優於動力。前者可以訓練，後者轉瞬即逝。如果你只依靠動力，你將無法完成偉大的事情。

9\. You can improve your communication skills with practice much more effectively than you can improve your intelligence with practice. If you’re not that smart but can communicate ideas clearly, you have a great advantage over everybody who can’t communicate clearly.  
9\. 你可以通過練習來提高你的溝通技巧，而不是通過練習來提高你的智力。如果你不是那麼聰明，但能清楚地傳達想法，那麼你比那些不能清晰溝通的人有很大的優勢。

10\. You do not live in a video game. There are no pop-up warnings if you’re about to do something foolish, or if you’ve been going in the wrong direction for too long. You have to create your own warnings.  
10\. 你不生活在電子遊戲中。如果您即將做一些愚蠢的事情，或者如果您已經朝著錯誤的方向前進太久，則不會彈出警告。您必須創建自己的警告。

13\. 讓事情盡可能簡單。找到開始鍛煉的最簡單方法。找到開始寫作的最簡單方法。人們讓事情變得比他們必須的更難，當他們無法成功時會感到沮喪。盡量不要這樣做。

14\. Cultivate a reputation for being dependable. Good reputations are valuable because they’re rare (easily destroyed and hard to rebuild). You don’t have to brew the most amazing coffee if your customers know the coffee will always be hot.  
14\. 樹立可靠的聲譽。良好的聲譽很有價值，因為它們很稀有（很容易被摧毀且難以重建）。如果您的客戶知道咖啡永遠是熱的，那麼您不必沖泡最美味的咖啡。

17\. 不要向同事或在網上抱怨你的伴侶。好處可以忽略不計，成本會摧毀你的一點靈魂。

18\. After a breakup, cease all contact as soon as practical. The potential for drama is endless, and the potential for a good friendship is negligible. Wait a year before trying to be friends again.  
18\. 分手後，儘快停止所有聯繫。戲劇的可能性是無窮無盡的，而建立良好友誼的可能性可以忽略不計。等一年後再嘗試再次成為朋友。

[28](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/497611-science-is-a-way-of-trying-not-to-fool-yourself). 注意到別人的偏見很容易，注意到自己的偏見很難。但是，它的回報要高得多。
