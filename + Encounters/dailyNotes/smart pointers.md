To understand the statement "Prefer smart pointers over raw pointers for better memory management," let's break it down:

### Raw Pointers
- **Definition**: Raw pointers are simple pointers that store the memory address of a variable.
- **Management**: They require manual memory management, meaning the programmer must explicitly allocate and deallocate memory using `new` and `delete` (or `malloc` and `free` in C).
- **Issues**:
  - **Memory Leaks**: If memory is allocated but not properly deallocated, it can lead to memory leaks.
  - **Dangling Pointers**: If a pointer points to deallocated memory, it becomes a dangling pointer, leading to undefined behavior.
  - **Double Deletion**: Attempting to delete the same memory twice can cause crashes.

### Smart Pointers
- **Definition**: Smart pointers are objects that act like pointers but also manage the memory they point to. They automatically deallocate memory when it is no longer needed.
- **Types**:
  - **`std::unique_ptr`**: Owns the memory exclusively and deletes it when the `unique_ptr` goes out of scope.
  - **`std::shared_ptr`**: Allows multiple pointers to share ownership of the same memory. The memory is deleted when the last `shared_ptr` pointing to it is destroyed.
  - **`std::weak_ptr`**: Works with `shared_ptr` but does not increase the reference count, useful for breaking reference cycles.
- **Benefits**:
  - **Automatic Memory Management**: Memory is automatically deallocated when the smart pointer goes out of scope or is reset.
  - **Avoids Memory Leaks**: By automatically managing memory, smart pointers help prevent memory leaks.
  - **Reduces Dangling Pointers**: Smart pointers ensure that memory is not accessed after it has been deallocated.

### Conclusion
- **Prefer Smart Pointers**: Using smart pointers like `std::unique_ptr` and `std::shared_ptr` can significantly improve memory management by automating the allocation and deallocation processes, thereby reducing the risk of common memory-related errors such as leaks, dangling pointers, and double deletions.

In summary, smart pointers provide a safer and more efficient way to manage memory in C++ by automating the memory management process, which is why they are preferred over raw pointers.
