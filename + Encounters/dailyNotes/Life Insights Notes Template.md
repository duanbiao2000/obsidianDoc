Explain how you feel about that now

When I was applying for a volunteering opportunity.
arrange an interview

woke up

not prepared for that

And I was really disappointed cause I felt, I was so cocky, I felt that I could definitely fit into the role and after that I think I learned that no matter how confident I am I should prepare for it and the pay my respect for whoever that in the interview and get up early.

Now I reflect on that and then I think that It's just a learn opportunity to make me adapt to interviews.

good story telling

storytelling ability

So really pushing herself from the vocabulary point of view which is nice.

## Is it important for people to share their honest opinions about things?

I will say in most situations it's better to be honest. if you can be honest about something and then solve the problem immediately that would be better if you push it back and then let things grow, eventually it's a mess. 

## Is there a good way to give constructive feedback to someone about something?
As lone as you are constructive you're not targeting anyone then it's really good to provide constructive feedback that can help a person grow,  they can benefit from that experience, No matter it's in the  near future or the long run, a constructive advice is always useful.

## What can people learn from feelings of disappointment?

We should be used to it because it's just human nature to feel disappointed but in fact, what happens afterward is more important.

**更简洁直接的表达：**

- **Option 1:** Disappointment is normal. What matters is what you do next.
    - (失望是正常的。重要的是接下来你做什么。)
- **Option 2:** It's natural to feel let down sometimes, but it's what you do after that counts.
    - (有时候感到失望是很正常的，但重要的是你接下来的行动。)

**更强调情感的表达：**

- **Option 3:** We all experience disappointment. It's part of being human. What truly matters is how we choose to move forward.
    - (我们都会经历失望。这是人之常情。真正重要的是我们选择如何前进。)
- **Option 4:** Disappointment is a tough pill to swallow, but it's how we bounce back that defines us.
    - (失望很难接受，但我们如何反弹才真正定义了我们。)

**更强调积极性的表达：**

- **Option 5:** While it's okay to feel disappointed, remember that every setback is an opportunity to grow.
    - (虽然感到失望是可以的，但要记住，每一次挫折都是成长的机会。)
- **Option 6:** Disappointment is temporary. Focus on the future and the possibilities that lie ahead.
    - (失望是暂时的。把注意力放在未来和未来的可能性上。)
