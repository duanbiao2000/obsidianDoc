Looking for Research opportunities
Discussion
I'm interested in joining research projects where there is a need for an apprentice or someone who's willing to take me under their wing so I can learn from them as my mentor.

I'm a self-taught developer who's worked across the stack: fullstack web dev, mobile(android & iOS), blockchain and web 3, ai/ml.

I'm interested in joining projects in AI/ML/DL but open to other fields also.
