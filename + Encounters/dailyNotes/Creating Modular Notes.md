## Creating Modular Notes: Building Blocks of Knowledge

### Example of a modular note:

- **Topic:** The concept of "flow"
- **Note:** "Flow is a state of optimal experience characterized by complete immersion in an activity. It occurs when challenges are appropriately matched to skills, leading to a sense of control and enjoyment."\
  **注意：** “心流是一种最佳体验状态，其特征是完全沉浸在活动中。 当挑战与技能适当匹配时，就会发生这种情况，从而产生控制感和享受感。“

**Modular notes** are the cornerstone of the Zettelkasten method. ==They are individual units of information, each focused on a single idea or concept.==

### Key principles for creating modular notes:

- **One idea per note:** This is fundamental. Each note should contain only one core thought.
- **Clarity and conciseness:** Express the idea clearly and succinctly.
- **Independence:** Each note should be understandable on its own, without relying on other notes.
- **Depth:** While concise, the note should delve deep into the subject matter.
- **Future-proofing:** Consider how the note might be used in different contexts.

- ==**Review and refine:** Regularly revisit your notes to improve clarity and depth.==
- ==**Link related notes:** Connect notes that share common themes or ideas.==
