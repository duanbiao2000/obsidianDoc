## Score criteria

The grading criteria for the IELTS Speaking test are as follows:

**Fluency and coherence**

- Band 9: Speaks fluently with only rare repetition or self-correction; any hesitation is content-related rather than to find words or grammar.

> 9分：除了偶尔的重复或自我更正外，说话非常流利；任何犹豫都是与内容相关，而不是寻找单词或语法。

- Band 8: Speaks fluently with only occasional repetition or self-correction; hesitation is usually content-related and only rarely to search for language.

> 8分：除了偶尔的重复或自我更正外，说话非常流利；犹豫通常是与内容相关，很少是为了寻找语言。

- Band 7: Speaks at length without noticeable effort or loss of coherence; may demonstrate language-related hesitation at times, or some repetition and/or self-correction.

> 7分：说话时不需要明显努力就能保持连贯性；有时可能会表现出与语言相关的犹豫，或一些重复和/或自我更正。

- Band 6: Is willing to speak at length, though may lose coherence at times due to occasional repetition, self-correction or hesitation.

> 6分：愿意长时间说话，但有时可能会因为偶尔的重复、自我更正或犹豫而失去连贯性。

- Band 5: Usually maintains flow of speech but uses repetition, self-correction and/or slow speech to keep going.

**Grammatical range and accuracy**

- Band 9: Uses a full range of structures naturally and appropriately; produces consistently accurate structures apart from 'slips' characteristic of native speaker speech.

> 9分：自然而恰当地使用各种结构；除了母语者语言中特有的“失误”外，结构始终准确。

- Band 8: Uses a wide range of structures flexibly; produces a majority of error-free sentences with only very occasional inappropriacies or basic/non-systematic errors.

> 8分：灵活地使用广泛的结构；大多数句子无错误，只有非常偶尔的不当或基础/非系统性错误。

- Band 7: Uses a range of complex structures with some flexibility; frequently produces error-free sentences, though some grammatical mistakes persist.

> 7分：使用一系列复杂的结构，具有一定的灵活性；经常产生无错误的句子，尽管一些语法错误仍然存在。

- Band 6: Uses a mix of simple and complex structures, but with limited flexibility; may make frequent mistakes with complex structures though these rarely cause comprehension problems.

> 6分：使用简单和复杂结构的混合，但灵活性有限；可能在使用复杂结构时经常犯错，尽管这些错误很少导致理解问题。
