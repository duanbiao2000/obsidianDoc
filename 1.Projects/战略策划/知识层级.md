### [[A Pragmatic Framework for Knowledge Tiers]]

After some reflection, it strikes me that our struggle with memory isn't about having a "bad" memory, but about lacking a `pragmatic` and `sustainable` system. We treat all knowledge as equal, which is inefficient. The key is to build a personal `Knowledge Processing Pipeline`, guided by simplicity and practicality.

This framework is my attempt to formalize that pipeline.

#### The Three Tiers of Knowledge

My system now categorizes all incoming information into three distinct `Tiers`. Each has its own principle, toolset, and `product mindset`.

**Tier 1: The Index Layer (索引层)**
*   **What it is:** Information I only need to know exists and where to find it. This is about `awareness`, not `retention`.
*   **Core Principle:** `Just-in-time access over just-in-case memorization`. My brain's capacity is finite; my hard drive's is not.
*   **Actionable Tools:**
    *   `Bookmarks`: For key articles or documentation.
    *   `Notion/Obsidian Database`: A simple table with `Keyword`, `URL`, and a one-sentence `Description`.
*   **Product Mindset:** Treat this layer as my personal, curated `Google`. The goal is search efficiency. If I can find it in under 15 seconds, the system is working.

**Tier 2: The Connection Layer (关联层)**
*   **What it is:** Knowledge that requires understanding the `logic`, the `context`, and the `"why"`. This is where true comprehension is built.
*   **Core Principle:** `Explain it to teach it`. If I can't articulate the connections in my own words, I don't truly understand it.
*   **Actionable Tools:**
    *   `Mind Maps (Xmind/Excalidraw)`: To visually map the relationships between concepts, like the components in a microservices architecture.
    *   `Atomic Notes (Obsidian)`: Writing concise notes that explain one single concept and linking it to others. This forces clarity.
*   **Product Mindset:** Each note or map is a `well-documented module` in my knowledge base. It should be clear enough for my "future self" to understand without effort.

**Tier 3: The Automation Layer (自动化层)**
*   **What it is:** High-value, hard-to-remember facts or procedures that need to be recalled effortlessly, almost as `muscle memory`.
*   **Core Principle:** `Automate recall for high-frequency actions`. Free up cognitive load for problem-solving, not for remembering syntax.
*   **Actionable Tools:**
    *   `Anki (Spaced Repetition System)`: The undisputed king here. Perfect for CLI commands, API syntax, or core vocabulary.
*   **Product Mindset:** Each Anki card is a `unit test` for my brain. It must be atomic, clear, and provide context (e.g., a code snippet or an example sentence).

#### The Pipeline in Action: A Practical Application

Here’s how this `tiered management` system applies to different domains. It's a simple, readable guide for where to put what.

| Domain (领域) | Tier 1: Index (索引) | Tier 2: Connection (关联) | Tier 3: Automation (自动化) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Microservices** | `Istio`, `Linkerd` names & links | `DDD` vs. `Microservices` architecture diagram | `kubectl get pods -n <namespace>` command |
| **AI Development** | New models like `Llama 3`, `Grok` | `Transformer`'s attention mechanism explained in my own words | `PyTorch`'s `nn.Module` boilerplate code |
| **English Vocabulary** | Obscure words like `quixotic` | The logic of prefixes like `re-`, `un-` | High-frequency words like `resilient`, `pragmatic` |

#### Meta-Conclusion: A Reflective Summary

Ultimately, this system is an exercise in `personal agency`. It's a conscious choice to stop being a passive consumer of information and become an active `architect` of my own understanding.

The goal is not to "remember more," but to build an `efficient system` that remembers for me. By applying these simple, practical tiers, the process of learning becomes less about brute force and more about elegant design. This, to me, is the most readable and sustainable path to mastery.
