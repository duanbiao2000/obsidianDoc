> What effect does this have on my mood? On my energy? On my productivity? 
> Don't rote-learn your way to feel-good productivity. 
> Experiment your way.

> Learning from your failures and celebrating your successes.
> Transforming your work from a drain on your resources to a source of energy.

The result will be goals that boost your energy and your feel-good productivity. But which don't ruin your life if you fail to hit them.

## Pre-mortem

Imagine it's one week later, and you haven't actually started the task you intended to.

> [!NOTE]
> What are the top three reasons why you didn't get to it?
>
> What can you do to help mitigate the risk of those top three reasons derailing you?
>
> Who can you ask for help in sticking to this commitment?
>
> What action can you take right now that will help increase the odds that you'll actually do the task?

> As General Eisenhower said, 'No battle was ever won according to plan, but no battle was ever won without one.'

> So far, we've examined how to work out our overall purpose – by asking the 'why' – and identifying specific end-goals and tasks – by asking the 'what'. But there's one more question we haven't answered. If you don't know when you're doing something, chances are you won't do it.

> If you decide beforehand when you're going to do something, you're much more likely to do it. According to Gollwitzer, the best formula for implementation intentions is a conditional statement: 'If X happens, then I will Y.'

> Time blocking isn't about creating a rigid schedule that stresses you out; it's about providing structure and ensuring there's dedicated time for what matters most to you. Once you have that, the fog of uncertainty will be that bit clearer.

## Define the Next Action Step

Pychyl told me that whenever he finds himself procrastinating from anything, he simply asks himself, 'What's the next action step?' For instance, when he knows he's procrastinating from doing yoga, his next action step is to roll out his yoga mat and stand on it. That's it.
