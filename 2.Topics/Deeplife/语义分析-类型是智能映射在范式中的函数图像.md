### **A Type Is a Result**

A type is not a label.
It is a result.
A process creates it.

---

### **The Process**

The process starts with an input.
A function acts on the input.

This happens inside a system.
The system is intelligent. It is self-aware.
The system works within a paradigm.

---

### **The Result**

The function's output is the result.
The paradigm shapes the result.
This final shape is the type.
It is the agent's behavior.

We do not find types.
We make them.
The type is the output of the whole system.
