I'd love to help you improve your English through role plays! Before we dive in, let me clarify a few things to make this most useful for you:

1. **What specific scenarios are most relevant to your work?** You mentioned presentations and meetings—are you looking to practice technical presentations, team standups, client presentations, leadership discussions, or something else?
    
2. **What's your current English level and main challenge?** For example, are you looking to work on:
    
    - Fluency and natural flow
    - Technical vocabulary specific to your domain
    - Confidence in high-stakes situations
    - Clarity in explaining complex concepts
    - Professional tone and formality
3. **How would you prefer to structure these role plays?** I can:
    
    - Play the other person (colleague, manager, client, audience member)
    - Give you feedback on your responses
    - Start with scripted scenarios or more improvised ones
    - Focus on specific phrases and expressions you find challenging
4. **How intensive do you want these?** Quick 5-minute exchanges, or longer, more realistic 15-20 minute scenarios?
    

Given your background as a Google engineer with 5 years of professional experience, I'm guessing you probably have solid foundational English but might want to refine it for specific contexts—maybe presenting technical ideas to non-technical stakeholders, or navigating nuanced workplace conversations?

Let me know what would be most valuable, and we can start with a scenario right away!
