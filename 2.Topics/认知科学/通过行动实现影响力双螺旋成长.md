### **Skill and Action**

You want influence. You need two things.
Skill. And action.

---

### **The Inner Work**

First, build your skill.
Go deep. Learn many things. Connect them.
Work hard. Your skill becomes instinct.
You develop taste. You see the right move.
This is your foundation.

---

### **The Outer Work**

Skill is not enough. It must be shown.
Build things. Solve problems. Write. Speak.
Your work creates impact. People see it. They trust you.
This is your proof.

### **The Helix**

The two parts feed each other.
Good work demands more skill.
More skill leads to better work.
One grows. The other follows.

Skill without action is a hidden treasure.
Action without skill is a loud noise.

Combine them. Your influence will grow.
It will compound.
