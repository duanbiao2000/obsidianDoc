# **Simple is Enough.**

It’s not about doing less. It’s about doing what matters.

By removing the unnecessary, you unlock the power to achieve extraordinary things. This is the discipline of simplicity.

### **Endurance**

Complexity is fragile. It breaks in unexpected ways.

Simplicity is robust. It’s easier to understand, easier to adapt, and easier to perfect. It’s designed for the long run.

### **Focus**

Every layer of complexity is a layer of distraction. Simplicity strips away the noise, leaving only the essential.

It gives you the clarity to concentrate your energy on what truly drives progress. To solve the right problem.

### **Power**

The greatest achievements aren’t born from endless features, but from a relentless focus on the core purpose.

Simplicity isn’t a limitation. It’s a force multiplier. It’s the shortest path from an idea to a masterpiece.

### **The Decision**

In a world that worships complexity, choosing simplicity is a deliberate act of intelligence.
在一个崇尚复杂的世界里，选择简单是一种深思熟虑的明智之举。

It’s the courage to say no to the non-essential. It’s the wisdom to know that “enough” is not a compromise, but the very definition of perfection.
这是对无关紧要之事说“不”的勇气。这是明白“足够”并非妥协，而是完美的真正定义的智慧。
