### **The First Rule of Competence**

Know your circle.
Know what you understand. Know what you do not.
The first rule is to act inside that circle. Make your big decisions there.

The greatest danger is the unknown. You do not know what you do not know.
Depth matters more than size. True competence is deep.

### **Traps in Your Work**

*   **Do not chase trends.** A new tool is not always a good tool. It can break your project. It can slow your team. Choose tools that work.

*   **Do not use black boxes.** You use a framework but you do not understand it. When it fails, you are lost. Read the code. Understand the machine.

*   **Do not ignore the system.** You build one part. You forget the whole. The system grows weak and brittle. Think about the entire structure. Keep it strong.

*   **Do not ship features over quality.** You rush to finish. The code is poor. The tests are few. You create debt. Quality comes first. Refactor your work.

### **Traps in Your Learning**

*   **Do not just collect.** You save articles. You watch videos. You do not study them. Your knowledge is shallow. Pick one topic. Go deep.

*   **Do not just run demos.** You copy the tutorial. The code runs. You learned little. Solve real problems. Build your own things.

*   **Do not seek magic tools.** You want a fast trick. You want one tool for every problem. There are no magic tools. Learn the fundamentals. They endure.

*   **Do not only consume.** You read. You listen. You do not write. You do not teach. The knowledge fades. To truly know something, explain it to others.

*   **Do not fear ignorance.** You pretend to know. You make bad decisions. You fail. Admit what you do not know. Ask for help. Find an expert.

Stay inside your circle.
Expand it slowly. Expand it with deep work.
This is how you build competence.
