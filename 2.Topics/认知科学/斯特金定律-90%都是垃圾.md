### **The Trap of Sturgeon's Law in Your Notes**

Sturgeon's Law states ninety percent of everything is crap. Many apply this to their notes. They see clutter and want to purge it.

This thinking is flawed.

1.  **Value changes.** Today's junk becomes tomorrow's insight. New connections give old notes new life.

2.  **Cleaning costs time.** It creates a risk. You might delete something vital by mistake.

3.  **Tags fail over time.** They grow complex. They cannot show deep connections. Maintaining them is a chore.

4.  **Some distractions are discoveries.** A clean vault can be a sterile one. It loses context. It creates new confusion.

Notes are not for storage. They are for thinking. Their true power lies in connection.

The goal is not a clean vault. The goal is a fertile mind. Find the balance.
