# Table of Contents: Excerpts from "The War of Art" by Steven Pressfield
**Foreword by Robert McKee**
- This foreword, written by renowned screenwriting guru Robert McKee, praises Pressfield's understanding of procrastination and the struggle to overcome creative blocks. McKee recounts personal anecdotes about his own battles with procrastination and applauds Pressfield's practical advice, particularly in "Turning Pro." While he praises the insightful analysis of Resistance throughout the book, McKee also highlights a point of divergence regarding the source of inspiration. He suggests that while Resistance might be genetic, inspiration stems from talent, a separate genetic predisposition, rather than from a "higher realm" as Pressfield proposes.

**What I Know**
- This short section presents Pressfield’s central argument: the most challenging aspect of writing is not the act itself but overcoming the resistance to starting.
**The Unlived Life**

## The War of Art: FAQ
**Based on the book "The War of Art" by Steven Pressfield**, this FAQ addresses the concept of Resistance and how to overcome it to achieve creative fulfillment.
**1. What is "Resistance" as defined in "The War of Art"?**
Resistance is an invisible, negative force that prevents us from pursuing our creative calling. It's the voice of self-doubt, procrastination, and fear that arises from within and sabotages our efforts to do our most authentic work. It manifests in various forms, such as procrastination, self-dramatization, and seeking validation from others, anything to distract us from the path of our true calling.
**2. How does Resistance manifest in our lives?**
Resistance is cunning and adaptable. It disguises itself as procrastination, unhealthy habits, fear of judgment, self-doubt, and even the allure of immediate gratification. It can also appear as rationalizations for avoiding our work, leading us to believe we lack the time, resources, or talent to pursue our creative passions.
**3. If Resistance is invisible, how do I know I'm experiencing it?**
Pay attention to your inner dialogue and behavior. Do you find yourself constantly putting off important creative tasks? Are you easily distracted from your goals? Do you feel a sense of dread or anxiety when you think about your work? These are all telltale signs of Resistance.
**4. Why is Resistance so powerful?**
Resistance draws its strength from our fear. The more we fear it, the more power we give it. It preys on our deepest insecurities, convincing us that we're not good enough, talented enough, or worthy of pursuing our dreams.
**5. What does it mean to "turn pro" in the face of Resistance?**
Turning pro is a mindset shift from amateur to professional in our approach to creative work. It means showing up consistently, mastering our craft, seeking order and discipline, and detaching our ego from the outcome. Professionals understand that success is a byproduct of consistent effort and dedication, not a guarantee.
**6. How does turning pro help overcome Resistance?**
When we turn pro, we stop making excuses and start taking ownership of our creative journey. This shift in perspective disarms Resistance because it thrives on our fear and procrastination. By showing up consistently and dedicating ourselves to the work, we starve Resistance of its power.
**7. What role do "muses" and "angels" play in overcoming Resistance?**
Pressfield uses the concepts of "muses" and "angels" to represent the unseen forces of inspiration and support that guide us on our creative journey. By committing to our work and pushing through Resistance, we open ourselves up to these higher realms of creativity and allow them to work through us.
**8. What is the ultimate message of "The War of Art"?**
The book urges us to confront our fears, silence our inner critic, and embrace the transformative power of creative expression. It reminds us that we are all capable of living a more authentic and fulfilling life by dedicating ourselves to our true calling, whatever it may be.
