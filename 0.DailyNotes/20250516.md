### 📌 Interview-Ready Concepts

- Saga-based transaction across Order/Inventory/Payment
    
- Caching with Redis (with TTL)
    
- API Rate Limiting with Envoy or API Gateway
    
- Configuration using Spring Cloud Config / Consul KV
    
- Health check / readiness / liveness probes

# Microservice Engineering Interview Project

This project simulates a real-world e-commerce microservice architecture with 3 core services, an API gateway, observability, service mesh, and secure communication.

## Goals

- Evaluate microservice architectural skills
- Demonstrate production-readiness patterns
- Expose DevOps thinking (infra, CI/CD, observability)

## Tech Stack

Java + Go + Python | gRPC + Kafka | Kubernetes | Redis | PostgreSQL | OpenTelemetry | Keycloak

## Quick Start

```bash
docker-compose up --build
# or
skaffold dev
````

```

## 🎬 YouTube Script (Technical Intro, ~3-5 Minutes)

> **Title**: “Microservice Engineer Interview Project – Fullstack Template Walkthrough”

---

🎙️ **[Intro – 0:00]**

Hey folks! In this video, I’ll walk you through a complete microservice engineering interview project that demonstrates real-world production patterns — perfect if you’re prepping for senior backend or platform roles.

---

⚙️ **[Section 1 – Overview – 0:20]**

We’ve built an e-commerce simulation with three core services:

- `catalog-service` in Java with Spring Boot
- `cart-service` in Go using Go-Kit
- `order-service` in Python with FastAPI

They talk to each other over gRPC, and we expose the public API via a Node.js-based gateway using OpenAPI definitions.

---

🔐 **[Section 2 – Security & Auth – 1:00]**

Authentication is handled via Keycloak, and each request gets a JWT. The API gateway enforces role-based access control (RBAC). Services trust each other using mTLS configured via Istio.

---

📊 **[Section 3 – Observability – 1:30]**

We’ve integrated OpenTelemetry for tracing, logs are streamed into Loki, and metrics are pulled by Prometheus and visualized in Grafana. You get full visibility into request flow and latency.

---

🛡️ **[Section 4 – Resilience – 2:00]**

Each service includes:

- Circuit breakers (Resilience4j or Go’s resilience lib)
- Timeouts + retries
- Fallbacks

These simulate production-grade fault tolerance.

---

📦 **[Section 5 – CI/CD & DevOps – 2:30]**

We use Docker, Helm, and Kubernetes for container orchestration. GitHub Actions takes care of CI, and Skaffold enables live-reload style deployment to local K8s for fast feedback.

---

💬 **[Outro – 3:00]**

This project hits the key points that top tech companies evaluate — clean service boundaries, communication protocols, security, observability, and resilience.

Clone the repo, experiment with new languages, try adding a payment service or AI fraud detection, and use it to ace your next interview.
