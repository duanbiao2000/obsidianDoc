## Summary

1. Many factors play a role in determining where you end up — whether you succeed in achieving your goals or whether you give up.
2. One of the biggest mistakes when trying to achieve something is not clearly defining it first. When you don’t know what you want, it’s impossible to reach for it.
3. A great strategy and execution plan isn’t enough to succeed. You also need to build the discipline to act on it every single day.
4. Setbacks are disappointing and may even hurt, but don’t let them turn into permanent excuses to stop trying and give up.
5. Your beliefs play a crucial role in your experience, feelings and ultimately the way you act. Use your beliefs to move you towards your goals and not away from them.
6. Put in the hard work to get corrective feedback, let go of your ego and do what it takes to adjust, adapt and make corrections.
7. When you don’t know how to do something on your own or lack the knowledge and expertise, there’s no shame or harm in getting the help you need.
