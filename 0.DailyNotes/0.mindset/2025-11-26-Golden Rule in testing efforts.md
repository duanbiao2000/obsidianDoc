The guide emphasizes foundational principles for effective JavaScript and Node.js testing, prioritizing test readability, maintainability, and reliability across different application layers. A central tenet, referred to as the "Golden Rule," advocates for designing tests that are simple, concise, and easy to understand, thereby reducing the cognitive load on developers. This approach promotes "lean testing," where the focus is on achieving a high return on investment (ROI) from testing efforts by minimizing complexity and maximizing clarity, as detailed in files like [`readme-fr.md`](https://github.com/goldbergyoni/javascript-testing-best-practices/blob/63a2bb07bb718d0a34a9c1249ef0df9b1266dad8/readme-fr.md) and [`readme-es.md`](https://github.com/goldbergyoni/javascript-testing-best-practices/blob/63a2bb07bb718d0a34a9c1249ef0df9b1266dad8/readme-es.md).
