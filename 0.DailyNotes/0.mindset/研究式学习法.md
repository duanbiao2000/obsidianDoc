### **MEMORANDUM**

**To:** All Teams
**From:** Strategy & Operations
**Date:** 2025-11-11
**Subject:** New Framework for Inquiry-Based Problem-Solving

**1. Objective**

To improve our innovation and decision-making, we are adopting a standardized Inquiry-Based Framework. This model shifts our approach from reacting with surface-level solutions to systematically investigating and solving core business challenges. It will be our standard for all major projects.

**2. The Core Principle: Solve Problems Like a Researcher**

This framework is built on one principle: we must address challenges like researchers. This means leading with critical questions, grounding our decisions in evidence, and prioritizing validated learning over assumptions. This structured approach ensures we solve the right problems effectively.

**3. The 6-Phase Inquiry Framework**

All strategic initiatives will now follow this six-phase process:

| Phase | Core Task | Key Question to Ask |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **1. Define the Problem** | Isolate a specific, measurable, and solvable business question from a broader challenge. | What is the precise problem we need to solve, and why does it matter? |
| **2. Formulate a Plan** | Design a clear plan outlining the investigation's goals, methods, resources, and timeline. | How will we find the answer? What data do we need, and how will we get it? |
| **3. Gather Evidence** | Execute the plan by collecting relevant quantitative and qualitative data from reliable sources. | What does the data say? Are we collecting unbiased, high-quality information? |
| **4. Analyze & Hypothesize** | Synthesize the evidence to identify patterns, validate or reject initial assumptions, and form a core hypothesis. | What story does the data tell? What is our evidence-based explanation for the problem? |
| **5. Conclude & Recommend** | Formulate a clear conclusion based on the analysis and propose a specific, actionable recommendation. | Based on our findings, what is the single most effective action we should take? |
| **6. Review & Scale** | Review the process and outcomes. Apply the learnings to future projects and scale successful solutions. | What did we learn from this process? How can we apply this solution elsewhere? |

**4. Business Applications & Advantages**

This framework is designed for complex challenges across all functions:

*   **Product Development:** Investigating the root cause of user churn instead of just adding features.
*   **Market Strategy:** Identifying unmet customer needs through data analysis instead of relying on assumptions.
*   **Operational Improvement:** Pinpointing the true bottleneck in a process instead of treating symptoms.

Adopting this framework will lead to:
*   **Deeper Insights:** Move beyond obvious answers to uncover foundational issues.
*   **Reduced Risk:** Make fewer decisions based on guesswork and more on validated evidence.
*   **Increased Ownership:** Empower teams to find their own answers and drive solutions.

**5. Next Steps**

We will begin piloting this framework on all new projects starting next quarter. A brief training session and playbook will be provided to guide teams through the process.
