### **How to Control an AI**

You must control the AI. It does not control you.
This is a system. It has five steps.
Use them. You will get better work.

---

### **1. Set the Rules**

Give the AI its laws. Do this first.
Tell it who to be.
Tell it the mission.
State the limits.
These rules do not change. They are the foundation.

---

### **2. Show a Good Example**

Show the AI what you want. Do not just tell it.
Give it one perfect example.
The AI learns from patterns. It will copy the good work.
This is faster than using many words.

---

### **3. Clear the Context**

Long talks confuse the AI. It forgets the mission.
Stop the talk. Tell the AI to summarize.
The summary must be short.
Throw away the old talk. Work only from the summary.
This keeps the work on track.

---

### **4. Demand the Process**

Do not accept a final answer.
Make the AI show its work.
Ask for the steps. Ask for the logic.
This opens the black box. You can see the flaws.
You can fix the thinking, not just the result.

---

### **5. Use a Scorecard**

Do not say "make it better." This is a weak command.
Give the AI a scorecard. List the rules for good work.
Tell the AI to grade itself.
Then tell it to fix the low scores.
This gives clear targets. It makes the work strong.
