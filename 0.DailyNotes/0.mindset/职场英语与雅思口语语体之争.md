### 1. IELTS vs. Workplace English — structural contrast

| Dimension              | IELTS Writing                                                    | Western/American Professional Writing                                 |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**            | Showcase language range & argumentation                          | Convey decisions, reasoning, or information efficiently               |
| **Tone**               | Academic, impersonal, often verbose                              | Direct, confident, human but concise                                  |
| **Sentence structure** | Complex syntax (subordination, nominalization)                   | Simple-to-moderate length, active voice preferred                     |
| **Lexical choice**     | Formal synonyms, abstract nouns (“assumption”, “implementation”) | Plain but precise verbs and nouns (“decide”, “run”, “plan”, “budget”) |
| **Reader expectation** | Examiner seeking structure and coherence markers                 | Colleague or executive skimming for signal and action points          |
| **Scoring logic**      | Range + grammatical accuracy                                     | Clarity + actionability + professionalism                             |

So for corporate or technical communication, you trade *linguistic ornament* for *cognitive efficiency*.
The reader should grasp the key message in a 10-second scan.

### 2. The new translation goal

When adapting from Chinese or IELTS-style English to Western workplace English, apply these rules:

1. **Front-load conclusions.**
   → Start with the key takeaway; context follows.
   Example: “Companies now face pressure to balance profit with social responsibility.”

2. **Use active voice unless passivity adds clarity.**
   → “The team launched the feature” beats “The feature was launched by the team.”

3. **Cut filler connectors.**
   → Replace “in order to,” “therefore,” “moreover” with concise logical sequencing. Often, punctuation and paragraphing already signal logic.

4. **Replace nominalizations with verbs.**
   → “Make an improvement” → “improve”; “conduct an analysis” → “analyze.”

5. **One idea per sentence, one decision per paragraph.**

6. **Use natural business collocations.**
   → “drive growth,” “meet targets,” “scale operations,” “manage risk.”

### 3. Example rewrite of the earlier Chinese passage

*(Converted to Western business English rather than IELTS English)*

> Companies are under growing pressure to balance profit goals with social responsibility. Some argue a firm’s duty is to maximize shareholder returns, while others believe it should prioritize the environment, employee welfare, and community impact. Acting responsibly can strengthen a brand and build long-term growth, but excessive focus on social issues may hurt competitiveness and margins.
>
> As governments, consumers, and investors raise expectations, business decisions are getting more complex. The challenge is to find a workable balance — protecting long-term enterprise value while contributing to society and the environment.

Note how it:

* Opens with the core point (no framing fluff).
* Keeps each sentence under ~25 words.
* Uses active, concrete verbs.
* Feels natural in a Western briefing or corporate memo.

### 4. Reasoning framework — translating toward clarity

1. **Extract the core idea per sentence** → remove decorative reasoning.
2. **Decide the communicative goal** → inform / persuade / decide / align.
3. **Choose register** → internal report, external memo, or public statement.
4. **Build a logical skeleton**: problem → impact → recommendation.
5. **Write in action verbs and short clauses.**
6. **Read aloud for scan-speed** — if you stumble, the reader will too.

Would you like me to demonstrate a side-by-side rewrite—IELTS vs. business version—for a longer paragraph, with a reasoning trace of each transformation step? That would show exactly how to pivot tone without losing precision.
