### **Building an Agent Ecosystem**

One agent is not enough. We build a team of agents.
They work together. They challenge each other.
This creates better results. The results are strong.

---

### **The Four Stages**

The system grows in four stages.
First, a user follows a plan.
Then, automation connects the steps.
The agents become strategic partners.
Finally, they form an ecosystem.

---

### **The Core Team**

The team has four key roles.

1.  **The Creative Agent** generates many ideas.
2.  **The Data Agent** scores the ideas. It finds the best ones.
3.  **The Red Team Agent** attacks the best ideas. It finds every flaw.
4.  **The Quality Agent** fixes the flaws. It prepares the final work.

An Arbiter makes the final choice.

### **The Process**

The process is a loop.

1.  Define the task. Define success with clear numbers.
2.  The Creative agent makes fifty drafts.
3.  The Data agent picks the top few.
4.  The Red Team attacks each one.
5.  The Quality agent revises them.
6.  The Arbiter picks the winners.

We ship the good work. We study the failures.

---

### **The System Improves**

The system learns. We set a weekly goal. We measure the work daily.
We watch the numbers.

*   If the Red Team misses flaws, we teach it new attacks.
*   If the final work is poor, we improve the Data agent's rules.
*   If the work needs many fixes, we train the Creative agent.

The loop closes. The system gets stronger.

### **The Red Team's Rules**

The Red Team's job is to break things.
It attacks from every side. Logic. Market. User. Rules.
It must find three flaws in each idea.
It must show how to prove the flaws.
Its report is simple: the attack, the evidence, the fix.
