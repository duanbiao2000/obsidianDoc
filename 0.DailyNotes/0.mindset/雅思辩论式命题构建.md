**事件核心：** 内容创作者户晨风通过视频展现社会底层及边缘群体的真实困境，引发巨大公众同情与讨论，但最终因触碰敏感议题而被平台封禁。

**抽象化命题：**

> Some people argue that social media platforms and authorities are justified in censoring content that exposes the harsh realities of societal problems, claiming it is necessary to maintain social harmony. Others contend that such content is a crucial form of social commentary that should be protected.
>
> Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.

*(有些人认为，社交媒体平台和有关部门有理由审查那些揭示社会问题残酷现实的内容，声称这是维护社会和谐所必需的。另一些人则认为，这类内容是一种至关重要的社会评论形式，应受到保护。)*

*   **分析：** 这个命题精准地抓住了事件的核心冲突。它不是简单地问“审查制度好不好”，而是将其置于“维护社会和谐”与“保护社会评论”的对立框架中，要求进行双边讨论，这正是高分作文所需要的思辨空间。

### 2. 优秀范文 (Band 8+ Essay)

In an era defined by digital connectivity, social media has evolved into a powerful dual-faced arena: a space for connection and a mirror reflecting society's often-unseen fissures. The rise of citizen journalism, where individuals document and share the stark realities of marginalized communities, has sparked a fierce debate. One school of thought posits that censoring such "inconvenient truths" is a necessary measure to preserve social cohesion, while an opposing view champions this content as an indispensable catalyst for progress. While the desire for a stable society is understandable, I firmly believe that suppressing these raw portrayals of reality is not only ethically questionable but also profoundly counterproductive to a nation's long-term health.

The primary justification for censorship often revolves around the concept of maintaining social stability and positive public morale. Proponents of this view argue that a constant stream of content depicting poverty, inequality, or systemic failures can erode public trust in institutions, foster widespread discontent, and ultimately threaten the social fabric. From a governance perspective, such narratives can be perceived as a direct challenge to official reports of progress and prosperity, potentially creating an atmosphere of negativity that could be exploited to incite unrest. In this light, censorship is framed not as an act of suppression, but as a pragmatic, paternalistic tool to shield the general populace from despair and to manage the collective emotional landscape, thereby ensuring a harmonious, forward-looking society.

However, this perspective fundamentally misinterprets the function of social commentary and underestimates the resilience of a well-informed public. Content that exposes societal underbellies, far from being merely a source of negativity, serves as a vital societal feedback loop. It is the modern equivalent of the canary in the coal mine, providing unfiltered, real-time data on the efficacy of social policies and the lived experiences of the most vulnerable citizens. For instance, a viral video of an elderly citizen struggling to afford basic necessities does more than evoke sympathy; it poses a critical question about the adequacy of the social safety net. To censor this is akin to disabling a fire alarm because its sound is jarring. It mistakes the warning signal for the problem itself, allowing the actual fire—the root cause of the suffering—to burn unseen and unaddressed.

In my opinion, true and sustainable social harmony cannot be built upon a foundation of curated ignorance. A society that systematically silences the voices of its most disadvantaged members is not a stable one; it is a fragile one, brittle to the touch of reality. The discomfort generated by videos like those of Hu Chenfeng is not a threat, but a prerequisite for meaningful change. It galvanizes public awareness, fuels charitable action, and can pressure policymakers to enact more compassionate and effective reforms. Therefore, protecting this form of expression is not an endorsement of negativity, but an investment in a society's capacity for self-correction and genuine progress. A truly confident and harmonious society is one that has the courage to look into the mirror, acknowledge its imperfections, and commit to addressing them.

### 3. 深度认知解析 (Deeper Understanding)

这篇范文是如何力求提供“更深刻认知”的？

1.  **超越“自由 vs. 管控”的二元对立：**
    *   文章没有停留在“言论自由好，审查制度坏”的浅层口号上。它深入探讨了审查制度背后的逻辑——即官方视角下的“维稳”需求和“社会情绪管理”（managing the collective emotional landscape）。这承认了问题的复杂性。

2.  **引入“社会反馈回路” (Societal Feedback Loop) 的系统思维模型：**
    *   这是本文的核心洞见。它将户晨风式的视频内容，从简单的“揭露黑暗面”，重新定义为**一个健康社会赖以运转的、必不可少的“反馈机制”**。就像人体的痛觉神经，它的存在虽然不悦，但却是机体自我保护和修复的关键。
    *   **“煤矿里的金丝雀” (Canary in the coal mine)** 和 **“火警警报器” (Fire alarm)** 这两个比喻，将这个抽象概念具象化了。审查这种内容，无异于杀死报信的鸟或关掉警报器，这是一种自欺欺人的行为，最终会让小问题恶化成大危机。

3.  **重新定义“和谐”与“稳定”：**
    *   文章最后一部分对“和谐”进行了重新诠释。它区分了两种“稳定”：一种是基于信息管制和压制真相的**“脆弱的稳定” (fragile stability / curated ignorance)**；另一种是基于直面问题、解决问题的**“有韧性的和谐” (resilient harmony / genuine progress)**。
    *   这提供了一个强有力的论点：户晨风的行为，短期看是“制造不和谐”，但长期看，是通往“真正和谐”的必经之路。真正的自信，源于敢于直面不完美。

通过这三个层面的递进，文章希望引导读者思考：我们追求的究竟是一种万马齐喑的表面“和谐”，还是一种能够不断自我修正、充满活力的真实“和谐”？这正是对户晨风事件更深层次的社会学反思。
