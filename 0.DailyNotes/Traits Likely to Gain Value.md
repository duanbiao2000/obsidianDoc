## **What might become more valuable**

  
Here are a few things that, based on the current direction of our world, may become more valuable than they are today.  
  

- **Trustworthiness**

- Increasing amounts of AI slop and tech may make it even harder to trust people, companies, and brands in the future.

- **Having a real audience**

- Piggybacking on trustworthiness, having a real and dedicated audience (or group of people) that appreciates you and likes what you do may become more helpful. This does not mean ‘be an influencer’, and in fact it’s possible that influencers, at least certain kinds, may become less popular over time.

- **Doing things in real life**

- Tech, AI, VR, etc. continue to make it increasingly easy to not do things in real life. To connect with anyone from your home. Which may mean that in-person interactions become even more special, unique, and valuable.

- **Craftspeople**

- If AI, tech, and robots can do a decent job, it becomes more valuable to do a spectacular job. Like how the rise of fast fashion has led to **[a boom in vintage and artisan clothing](https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/snatch/the-vintage-boom-how-secondhand-fashion-is-taking-over-the-global-market/).**

- **Specializing**

- [The Burden of Knowledge](https://thegeneralist.substack.com/p/ai-and-the-burden-of-knowledge) will make it harder to become knowledgeable to a level at which you can actually break new ground for humanity. So being truly great at lots of things will be harder—and it might be a better use of time to narrow your focus.

- **Being funny**

- May help with connection and having an audience.

- **Emotional and mental health in the age of AI**

- Knowing how to stay sane and happy will be especially useful in a world in which 1. Automation may mean you don’t have much of a valuable skill and 2. We may be able to increase the standard of living to a point at which hard work is not necessary for many humans.

- **Agency and resourcefulness**

- It’s possible that everyone will have more power at their fingertips, and that deep memorization, knowledge, and recall may lose importance. So being great at using the resources at your fingertips—as opposed to just knowing things—may gain more value.

- **Top ~10 percent creativity**

- Generative AI can do creative work better than the bottom 50, 60 (or more) percent of most fields. Which may mean that being a uniquely creative human may gain more value than it already has.

- **Having good taste**

- We don’t have the perfect definition here. But it seems likely that in a world where there are more things than ever, and those things are more available to everyone, having an eye for what’s actually good will become more useful.

- **Being adaptable**

- This has always been valuable, but it’s also true that the status quo of our world is changing much faster than it did thousands of years ago. Adaptability becomes more important than it has ever been.

- **Kindness**

- Related to having a real audience and trustworthiness.
