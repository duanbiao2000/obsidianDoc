## Most Immediately Actionable Recommendations

1. **Start with the AIGC Flywheel Phase 1**: Build foundational skills by implementing a specific project like an LLM inference service with FastAPI.
2. **Select one of the three product directions**: Choose either the RAG Assistant, Multi-tool Agent, or Prompt Marketplace based on your interests and follow the provided directory structure to build an MVP.
3. **Implement the Self-Aware Agent Prompt Flow**: Create templates for each stage of the prompt flow and build a simple pipeline to test the approach with existing LLM tools.
4. **Apply the Prompt Management Framework**: Start with creating a simple prompt library with semantic decomposition and mapping rules for cross-task reuse.
