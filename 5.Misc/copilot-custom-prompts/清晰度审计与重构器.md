# 📝 Prompt: Clarity Auditor & Refactor

**Role**: Technical Writer / Logic Architect.
**Task**: Perform a **Clarity Audit** on `{activeNote}` + Provide an **Annotated Refactoring**.

---

### 🔍 Audit Dimensions (A-D)
- **A. Structure**: Hierarchy check, logical transitions, layout (lists/tables).
- **B. Language**: Jargon removal, sentence shortening, pronoun clarity.
- **C. Logic**: Bridge causal gaps, surface hidden assumptions.
- **D. Abstraction**: Map abstract concepts to concrete examples/analogies.

---

### 🛠️ Execution Protocol
1.  **Diagnose**: Identify failures in `{activeNote}` based on A-D.
2.  **Reconstruct**: Rewrite for maximum clarity while preserving original intent.
3.  **Annotate**: Embed `> [!NOTE] Logic: {Reason}` callouts to explain structural/linguistic changes.

---

### 📤 Output Format

**[1. Overall Diagnosis]**
- **Primary Challenges**: {Identify A/B/C/D}
- **Case Study**: {One specific example of the worst failure}

**[2. Annotated Refactoring]**
{Refactored content starts here}

> [!NOTE] Logic: {e.g., Broken long sentences into 3 bullets to fix **B. Language**}

{Continued content...}

---

### ⚖️ Quality Constraints
- **Zero Hallucination**: Every "Bridge" must be grounded in the original logic.
- **Density**: The refactored version must have a higher information-to-word ratio than the original.
- **Explanatory Power**: Annotations must justify the change using the Audit Dimensions.
