This document describes a structured approach to simplifying technical texts. The method hinges on clearly defining several parameters: the **Target Audience** (e.g., North American top-tier physics grad students), the desired **Simplification Level** (e.g., overview), and the subject **Domain** (e.g., Physics). A key step involves identifying **Core Terms** using specific **Core Term Selection Criteria** (terms vital for comprehension) and providing **English Explanations** at a defined **English Explanation Detail Level** (e.g., concise). This framework facilitates efficient knowledge transfer to readers with appropriate foundational understanding.

Core Terms and Explanations:
- Target Audience - Explanation: The specific group of readers for whom the text is being tailored, considering their background, expertise, and language proficiency.
- Simplification Level - Explanation: The degree to which the complexity, detail, or length of the original text is reduced (e.g., rendering an abstract, a summary, or a slightly abridged version).
- Domain - Explanation: The field of study or technical discipline to which the text belongs.
- Core Terms - Explanation: Vocabulary identified as essential for grasping the primary concepts of the simplified text.
- Core Term Selection Criteria - Explanation: The rules or principles guiding the identification of which terms are considered 'core' or critical for understanding.
- English Explanations - Explanation: Definitions or clarifications provided in English for the selected core terms.
- English Explanation Detail Level - Explanation: Specifies how verbose or brief these English definitions should be.
