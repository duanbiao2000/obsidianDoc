## 12 Zettelkasten Card Generator

Based on {activeNote} as the core source, and applying the principles of the Feynman Learning Technique, generate several note cards in the Zettelkasten (Luhmann's slip-box) format:

### Reference Examples:

**Card 1**

**ID:** `202405241015A`  
**Tags:** `#goal-oriented` `#feynman-method` `#first-principles` `#focus` `#action-foundation` `#info-filter-premise`  
**Title:** **Goal Orientation: The Foundation and Compass for Action (Why Goal First?)** ^goalfirst

**Content:**  
The essence of goal orientation is: Before taking any action (especially information gathering), you must **clearly know where you are going and what outcome you want to achieve**. This is like setting a GPS destination; without it, even the fastest engine (effort) might just spin in place or head in the wrong direction.

1.  **Core Question (Feynman Test)**: **What do you actually want**? (e.g., Find an ideal job? Master a specific skill? Solve a particular business problem?) Your goal must be specific enough to guide your "what to do next."
2.  **Purpose**:
    *   Provides a **reason to focus**: Makes it clear where time and energy should be directed.
    *   Establishes **filtering criteria**: A clear goal is the **primary basis** for judging if information is relevant or valuable.
    *   Resists distraction: Helps you ignore information temptations that seem interesting but are irrelevant to your destination.

Effort without a clear goal is often inefficient or even ineffective. Set the direction first, then talk about efficiency.

**Card 2**

**ID:** `202405241015B`  
**Tags:** `#information-filtering` `#feynman-method` `#cognitive-load` `#attention` `#critical-thinking` `#efficiency`  
**Title:** **Information Filtering: The Signal-from-Noise Filter (Filtering Noise)** ^filternoise

**Content:**  
Information filtering ability is the key **filtering mechanism** for staying clear-headed and efficient in an information-saturated environment. Its core is the ability to quickly and effectively select high-quality information that is truly **useful for achieving your goals** when faced with a large volume of data.

1.  **Filtering Principles (Simplified)**: For each piece of information, quickly ask:
    *   Is it **relevant to my goal**?
    *   Is the source **reliable**?
    *   Is it **important** to me?
    *   Does it need **processing now**?
    Decisively discard information that is "irrelevant, unreliable, unimportant, or not urgent."
2.  **Importance**:
    *   **Protects attention**: This is your scarcest resource; prevent it from being consumed by irrelevant information.
    *   **Improves decision quality**: Make judgments based on higher quality, more relevant information.
    *   **Frees up cognitive resources**: Creates space for deep thinking and learning.

Efficient information filtering is like fueling your "goal engine" with **high-purity fuel**. Its effectiveness is **highly dependent** on clear goals [[#^goalfirst]].
