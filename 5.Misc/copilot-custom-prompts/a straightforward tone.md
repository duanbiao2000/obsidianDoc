Retain the original language while revising the text within triple quotes to establish a straightforward tone. Strive for clarity and directness, eschew euphemisms or indirect statements, employ simple vocabulary, and ensure honesty as well as transparency without any hidden or misleading meanings. The revised output should align with the same dialect or language variety as initially presented in the text. Deliver only the reworked output without any additional content, and do not enclose your response in quotation marks.
